                    <p>H1, my name is Ghassan, and I wake up every day excited to learn new cutting
                        edge techniques for developing smooth and modern web-site experiences. I am
                        already fluent in technologies such as React.js, Angular, JavaScript, TypeScript,
                        SQL, HTML, and CSS. Below you will find some examples of my skills.
                        <br /><br />
